## Description
I have recently experienced quarantine. I now know how it feels to stay alone in a little room for 14 days. Being a developer, I decided to make an app that won't let people get lonely and bored during their quarantines.

## Features
- A chatbot (1)

(1) - A web chatterbot instance will power the main feature of the app. The chatbot will speak to the users as if a real person were talking to them. The chatbot will also be able to respond to the users' questions related to covid-19. The chatbot will encourage the users to stay safe and take care of themselves, and will also be able to provide information about the latest news and updates regarding covid-19. It will remind the users to take their medications and to wash their hands on a regular basis.
