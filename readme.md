# Unnamed project
##### This proejct is unnamed, so if you have a name for it, please open an issue.

## Description
I have recently experienced quarantine. I now know how it feels to stay alone in a little room for 14 days. Being a developer, I decided to make an app that won't let people get lonely and bored during their quarantines.

## Features
- A chatbot (1)

(1) - A web chatterbot instance will power the main feature of the app. The chatbot will speak to the users as if a real person were talking to them. The chatbot will also be able to respond to the users' questions related to covid-19. The chatbot will encourage the users to stay safe and take care of themselves, and will also be able to provide information about the latest news and updates regarding covid-19. It will remind the users to take their medications and to wash their hands on a regular basis.

## Running the app
```
$ git clone https://github.com/somePythonProgrammer/UnnamedProject.git
$ cd UnnamedProject
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
##### Press `ctrl + c` to stop the app.
##### Open an AVD emulator and press `a` in the terminal to start the app on emulator.

## Credits
